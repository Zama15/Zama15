# Having EndeavourOS as the Only OS on Your Machine

## 1. Removing Windows

To remove Windows, first install **GParted**:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gparted
```

Then, open GParted:

```bash
sudo gparted
```

Here’s what to do:

1. Locate all your **EndeavourOS partitions** — the ones you **should not touch**. These usually include:

   * `/` (root)
   * `efi/`
   * Any other partitions you’ve set up, like `/home`, `/swap`, `/tmp`

2. After identifying those, find the **Windows partitions** and **delete them**:

   * Right-click the Windows partition → `Delete`
   * You’ll now see **unallocated space**.
   * Confirm everything looks correct, then click the **check mark** (✓) at the top to apply the changes.

## 2. Expanding Your EndeavourOS Partition

Now that you’ve got unallocated space, you probably want to **expand your EndeavourOS partition** (e.g. `/`, `/home`) to use that space.

* Right-click the partition you want to expand → `Resize/Move`
* A window will pop up. **Slide** the edge to increase the partition size or manually enter the new size.

> [!NOTE]
> If the Unallocated Space Is on the Left
> GParted **can’t move partitions to the left** if they’re mounted. That means if the unallocated space is on the **left**, and you want to grow your `/` partition into it, you'll need to use a **live boot environment** where the system partition isn’t mounted.

## 3. Resizing the Partition in a Live Boot

> [!CAUTION]
> Note on Boot Issues.
> This action **could** mess up your boot loader. I personally did all of these steps and my system booted fine afterward. But just so you know — this is not guaranteed, so in case anything breaks, you’ll have to search for solutions online. (I don’t have a fix for that kind of issue at the moment.)

### a. Create a Boot Stick

1. Download the EndeavourOS ISO from the [official website](https://endeavouros.com/).
2. Insert your flash drive.
3. Create the boot stick with:

```bash
sudo dd if=EndeavourOS.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress && sync
```

> [!WARNING]
> Replace `/dev/sdX` with the **correct disk** (not a partition like `/dev/sdX1`). **⚠️ This will wipe everything on the flash drive, so back it up first.**

### b. Use GParted from the Live Boot

1. Boot into the flash drive.
2. Open a terminal and install GParted (if not already there):

```bash
sudo pacman -S gparted
```

3. Launch GParted:

```bash
sudo gparted
```

4. Now do the same process:

   * Right-click your EndeavourOS partition → `Resize/Move`
   * This time, you’ll be able to **move/slide the partition to the left**, because it’s not mounted.
   * Resize it to take up the unallocated space.

5. Click the **check mark** to apply the changes. A **warning** will pop up — **read it carefully.**

## Done!

You now have the **best OS ever** as your main and only system. Goodbye Windows, hello power and freedom.

# Removing GRUB on Boot

Now that you only have **EndeavourOS**, GRUB might feel useless. If you want to **boot directly into EndeavourOS**, follow these steps.

But first, **let me be clear**:
This guide **does not** remove the GRUB package, its files, or touch anything that could brick your system through deletion.
Instead, this will help you **create a new boot entry** that boots directly, cleanly — without GRUB and without all the annoying text logs.

Let’s get into it.

> [!CAUTION]
> Note on Boot Issues
> Just like resizing partitions, messing with EFI entries and bootloaders **can** break things.
> That said — I personally followed all of these steps and had **zero issues**. My system booted clean, without GRUB, and straight into EndeavourOS.
> If something does go wrong (e.g. black screen, no boot), you’ll likely have to:
> * Boot from a live USB
> * Reinstall GRUB or systemd-boot
> * Tweak the EFI entries manually
> So proceed carefully, and **always back things up**.

## 1. Create the New Boot Entry

First, install the systemd-boot setup:

```bash
sudo bootctl install
```

This will create the necessary directories and files for a new boot entry. **Pay attention** to the output — you’ll need to know where these files live.

Example output:

```
Created "/boot/efi/EFI/systemd".
Created "/boot/efi/loader".
Created "/boot/efi/loader/keys".
Created "/boot/efi/loader/entries".
Created "/boot/efi/EFI/Linux".
Copied "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi" to "/boot/efi/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi".
Copied "/usr/lib/systemd/boot/efi/systemd-bootx64.efi" to "/boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI".
Random seed file /boot/efi/loader/random-seed successfully written (32 bytes).
Successfully initialized system token in EFI variable with 32 bytes.
Created EFI boot entry "Linux Boot Manager".
```

## 2. Check Kernel and Initramfs Paths

These files usually live in the `/boot/` directory. Check it:

```bash
sudo ls -l /boot/
```

You should see something like:

```
drwxr-x--- 5 root root - Dec 31  1969 efi
drwxr-xr-x 6 root root - Jun  4 14:10 grub
-rw------- 1 root root - Jun  6 13:57 initramfs-linux-fallback.img
-rw------- 1 root root - Jun  6 13:57 initramfs-linux.img
-rw------- 1 root root - Jun  6 13:56 initramfs-linux-lts-fallback.img
-rw------- 1 root root - Jun  6 13:56 initramfs-linux-lts.img
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root - Jun  6 13:56 vmlinuz-linux
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root - Jun  6 13:56 vmlinuz-linux-lts
```

## 3. Create the `endeavouros.conf` Entry

Since `bootctl install` created the boot structure in `/boot/efi/`, we need to copy the necessary files there for systemd-boot to work properly:

```bash
sudo cp /boot/vmlinuz-linux /boot/efi/
sudo cp /boot/initramfs-linux.img /boot/efi/
sudo cp /boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img /boot/efi/
```

Now create your boot entry file:

```bash
sudo nano /boot/efi/loader/entries/endeavouros.conf
```

Paste this into the file:

```
title   EndeavourOS
linux   /vmlinuz-linux
initrd  /initramfs-linux.img
initrd  /initramfs-linux-fallback.img
options root=UUID=<your-root-partition-uuid> rw loglevel=3 nowatchdog
```

Replace `<your-root-partition-uuid>` with your actual root partition UUID. To get it:

```bash
lsblk -f
```

### a. Create a Pacman Hook to Auto-Copy on Kernel Updates

> [!NOTE]
> Since the copied files in `/boot/efi/` are **not** auto-updated by the system, we need a **Pacman hook** to keep them in sync.

Create the hook:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pacman.d/hooks
sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/hooks/90-systemd-boot-copy.hook
```

Paste this in:

```
[Trigger]
Type = Package
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Operation = Remove
Target = dracut
Target = linux
Target = linux-lts
Target = amd-ucode
Target = intel-ucode
Target = systemd

[Trigger]
Type = Path
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Target = usr/lib/modules/*/vmlinuz
Target = usr/lib/dracut/*
Target = usr/lib/firmware/*
Target = usr/src/*/dkms.conf

[Action]
Description = Copy kernel and initramfs to EFI system partition...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/bash -c 'cp -v /boot/vmlinuz-linux /boot/initramfs-linux*.img /boot/efi/'
```

This will ensure you’re always booting from the **latest kernel and initramfs**.

> [!WARNING]
> This hook assumes you're using the **default kernel packages** (`linux`, `linux-lts`) provided by Arch/EndeavourOS.
> If you're using a **custom kernel** like `linux-zen`, `linux-hardened`, or `linux-xanmod`, you'll need to **add those to the hook** with additional `Target =` lines. Otherwise, the hook won’t run when those kernels are updated, and your EFI files could become out of sync.
> You can check your installed kernels with:
> ```bash
> pacman -Q | grep linux
> ```

### b. Splash Animation (Optional)

To get a good-looking boot animation, I recommend installing **Plymouth** with this command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S plymouth
```

> [!WARNING]
> Arch-based systems like EndeavourOS support two initramfs generators: `mkinitcpio` and `dracut`. This guide assumes you're using the latest EndeavourOS, which defaults to `dracut`. If you're still using `mkinitcpio`, skip this section. This method is a minimal setup specifically for dracut users.

Normally, configuring Plymouth with dracut requires creating a config file that manually adds the `plymouth` module. But in recent versions, simply installing the `plymouth` package automatically enables the module in dracut. We’ll take advantage of that and regenerate the initramfs directly.

> [!TIP]
> If you're a KDE user like me, I recommend installing these extra tools for better integration:
> * `breeze-plymouth` – a splash theme that matches KDE's style
> * `plymouth-kcm` – a GUI tool to manage Plymouth themes
> ```bash
> sudo pacman -S breeze-plymouth plymouth-kcm
> ```

#### I. Edit the systemd-boot Entry

Open your bootloader entry file:

```bash
sudo nano /boot/efi/loader/entries/endeavouros.conf
```

Edit or add the `options` line to include `quiet splash` for a cleaner boot:

```ini
efi /EFI/Linux/endeavouros.efi
options root=UUID=... rw quiet splash loglevel=3 nowatchdog
```

#### II. Regenerate Initramfs (via Dracut)

Now, simply reinstall `dracut` to trigger the regeneration of the initramfs and let the hook copy it to the EFI partition:

```bash
sudo pacman -S dracut
```

Look for this in the output:

```
(5/6) Copy kernel and initramfs to EFI system partition...
'/boot/vmlinuz-linux' -> '/boot/efi/vmlinuz-linux'
'/boot/initramfs-linux.img' -> '/boot/efi/initramfs-linux.img'
'/boot/initramfs-linux-fallback.img' -> '/boot/efi/initramfs-linux-fallback.img'
...
```

This confirms that the initramfs was regenerated and copied successfully, with Plymouth now included.

To verify everything is in place, run:

```bash
bootctl list
```

## 4. Remove or Reorder Unwanted Boot Entries

To list your current boot entries:

```bash
sudo efibootmgr
```

You’ll see something like:

```
BootCurrent: 0000
Timeout: 0 seconds
BootOrder: 0000,0001,0002
Boot0000* Linux Boot Manager
Boot0001* Windows Boot Manager
Boot0002* endeavouros
```

To **remove** an entry:

```bash
sudo efibootmgr -b 0001 -B
```

Repeat for any entries you don’t want.

> [!NOTE]
> In my case:
>
> * `Boot0000` is the new systemd boot entry (✅ keep)
> * `Boot0001` was a leftover Windows entry (❌ removed)
> * `Boot0002` was the EndeavourOS GRUB entry (✅ keep)

If you **don’t want to delete** GRUB, you can just reorder boot priorities:

```bash
sudo efibootmgr -o 0000
```

## 5. Clean Up the EFI Directory

Check what’s there:

```bash
sudo ls /boot/efi/EFI/
```

Expected output:

```
Boot/
Linux/
Microsoft/
systemd/
endeavouros/
```

To remove Windows leftovers:

```bash
sudo rm -r /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft
```

> [!WARNING]
> You could also delete the GRUB folder here (`endeavouros/`), but I **don’t recommend** doing this unless you’re 100% sure.
> If something breaks, you may need to boot from live USB and fix it manually. Do your research.

## Done!

On your next reboot, you should boot straight into **EndeavourOS** —
no GRUB, no boot menu, no verbose text logs. Just clean and simple.

# Adding Virtual RAM on Low Resources Laptop

## 1. ZRAM

Compresses and decompresses memory in real time. Here it's used more like RAM, effectively getting virtual RAM from physical drives.

> \[!WARNING]
>
> * Because of the compress/decompress process, CPU load may increase, especially during heavy multitasking.
> * On a low-end or thermally throttled CPU, this could cause performance dips.

### a. Install

```bash
sudo pacman -S zram-generator
```

### b. Create Config File

Create the following file to configure ZRAM:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf
```

Add these lines to the file:

```
[zram0]
zram-size = min(min(ram, 4096) + max(ram - 4096, 0) / 2, 32 * 1024)
compression-algorithm = zstd
```

> \[!NOTE]
> This will create a "linear size 1:1 for the first 4G, then 1:2 above, up to a max of 32GB."
> More examples and tweaks [here](https://man.archlinux.org/man/zram-generator.conf.5)

### c. Reload service and start ZRAM generator

Reload systemd daemons to apply the new config:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start the ZRAM service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start systemd-zram-setup@zram0
```

> \[!NOTE]
> `@zram0` refers to the first ZRAM device (`/dev/zram0`). You can configure multiple devices (zram1, zram2…) but usually only one is needed.
>
> It's not necessary to enable the service because the generator dynamically creates the unit at boot time based on the config file.

## 2. SWAP

This will be used when the RAM overflows to the point where it would crash. It effectively works as a fallback, making it reliable for low-RAM machines during multitasking or heavy app usage. Here it's set up with the idea that [ZRAM](#zram) won’t be enough on its own.

> \[!WARNING]
>
> * Swap on an SSD adds write cycles, which can reduce SSD lifespan over years of intense use.
> * Although, if only using 2–4GB occasionally, it’s a minimal risk.

### a. Create a 4GB swapfile (change size as needed)

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
```

This command **reserves 4GB of space** on your disk and creates a file named `/swapfile`.
You can change `4G` to any value depending on how much fallback swap you want.

### b. Secure the file

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```

This sets permissions to **owner read/write only**, preventing other users or processes from accessing it — important for security and system stability.

### c. Format it as swap

```bash
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```

This command **initializes the file** as swap space so the system can recognize and use it as additional memory.

### d. Enable it

```bash
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

This tells the kernel to **start using the swapfile immediately**, without needing a reboot.

You can verify it’s active with:

```bash
free -h
```

Look under the `Swap:` line — it should now show 4GB (or whatever size you picked).

### e. Make it permanent

Open `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add this line to the bottom of the file:

```
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
```

This tells the system to **mount the swapfile automatically at every boot**, so you don’t have to enable it manually each time.
